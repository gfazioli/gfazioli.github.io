I am an Italian Lead Developer who has recently moved this blog in the English language. Positive and creative, I’m a natural problem-solver, passionate about bringing ideas to life.\r\n\r\nI started developing in 1983! Amazing years! In the beginning,  I used to work in design and graphic applications. I worked on Commodore Vic-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, Amiga 1000, 500 and 2000. I loved to develop in Assembly; Z-80, 6510, 6520, 8086, 80×86 and Motorola series (680xx).\r\n\r\nNext, I was engaged by a telecommunication company as a program developer. I worked in C/C++ (Digital Unix and Sun OS), PHP, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++ and Macromedia Actionscript. I worked for them about 7 years and, after that, I become a freelance and decided to work for myself!\r\n\r\nSo I started my own company and startups, where my position was CTO.\r\n\r\nI am currently in charge as Lead Developer for [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"personal_info\" : {\r\n    \"first_name\" : \"Giovambattista\",\r\n    \"last_name\" : \"Fazioli\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"emails\" : [\r\n    \"giovambattista.fazioli@gmail.com\",\r\n    \"g.fazioli@undolog.com\"\r\n    ],\r\n  \"social\" : {\r\n    \"twitter\" : \"https://twitter.com/gfazioli\",\r\n    \"Facebook\" : \"https://www.facebook.com/undolog\",\r\n    \"Linkedin\" : \"https://it.linkedin.com/in/giovambattistafazioli\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"channels\" : {\r\n    \"slack\" : \"https://undolog.slack.com\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"repo\" : {\r\n    \"github\" : \"https://github.com/gfazioli\",\r\n    \"npm\" : \"https://www.npmjs.com/~gfazioli\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
